                        I am the co-founder of LUNIS, a project that we started
                        in order to explore new technology and ideas. I work
                        alongside a fullstack developer in order to create
                        products. Throughout working on Lunis projects, I have
                        acted as the sole designer, which has presented
                        countless opportunities and learnings. With large
                        emphasis on longevity for design and development, my
                        exploration of systems thinking and an engineering
                        approach has allowed me to learn more about the overlaps
                        of design and development.
