                        During this project I acted as the sole designer for a
                        web app that showcases instructional videos. With a
                        large global following, Sammy Picone is a successful
                        pole instructor leading innovation in the community. Our
                        site enables Sammy’s students to join her from all over
                        the world, with integrations from Vimeo and Patreon. We
                        aimed to create a site that was grounded in ease of
                        learning and beautiful in use. I led the planning
                        process, from iteration of features to creating flows,
                        wireframes, and designs.

                            Systems thinking grounds the core of my process,
                            which begins in research. My industry analysis led
                            me to discover that competitor sites were both
                            lacking in aesthetic and functionality, whilst a
                            look into related industries such as Yoga, provided

                            Our features were shaped around analysis of what our
                            users would need and want from the site. Refining
                            these features was a process of reflection and
                            iteration, each round of early revisions bringing us
                            closer to meeting the needs of our end users.
                            Constant evaluation enabled us to hone in on core
                            functionality, with the best parts of each version
                            assembling the final map.

                            As sammypicone.com is a video sharing platform that
                            functions as a learning space, familiarity was a
                            large focus when structuring final designs. A
                            priority throughout, was to ensure that the layout
                            and functionality would be easily adopted by our
                            users. Whilst exploring possibilities, I developed
                            many versions of lo-fi mockups before the final
                            product began to take shape. I believe that design
                            and development processes should inform one-another.
                            Each stage of the design evolved during
                            collaboration with the lead developer, as this
                            project became a strong example of engineering and
                            design informing each other.
